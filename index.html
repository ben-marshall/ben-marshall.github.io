<h1>My name is Ben</h1>
<p>
I am an engineer, and studied Computer Science and Electronics at the 
<a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk" target="_blank">University of Bristol</a>.
I work in CPU design and verification.
</p>
<h2>I like to build things:</h2>

<div class="pet-project-title">
<a href="https://github.com/ben-marshall/verilog-parser" target="_blank">
verilog-parser
</a></div>
<p class="pet-project-description">
A parser and syntax tree for the IEEE 1364-2001 Verilog Standard, built using
C, Flex and Bison. A good starting point for a custom HDL tool, though the
syntax tree is not brilliantly constructed. The parser corresponds very
closely to the language specification, which makes it much easier
to understand.

<div class="pet-project-title">
<a href="https://github.com/ben-marshall/sat-solver" target="_blank">
sat-solver
</a></div>
<p class="pet-project-description">
A simple implementation of the AC3 algorithm for boolean satisfiability
solving. Written using C, with a simple front-end language for expressing
sets of boolean constraint problems.
</p>

<div class="pet-project-title">
<a href="https://github.com/ben-marshall/verilog-probe" target="_blank">
verilog-probe
</a></div>
<p class="pet-project-description">
A tiny debug probe designed to be used with the <i>Arty</i> FPGA development
platform, but easily re-targetable for any HDL project. Uses a simple 
(and slow) UART interface to make AXI4 memory requests, and control general
purpose pins. Synthesises to work at 100MHz on the Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA.
</p>

<div class="pet-project-title">
<a href="https://github.com/ben-marshall/riscv-multi-cycle" target="_blank">
riscv-multi-cycle
</a></div>
<p class="pet-project-description">
A toy implementation of the RISC-V RV32I instruction set using an FSM based
multi-cycle architecture. Mainly an experiment in generating large state
machines automatically from a machine readable source. Synthesisable on
an Artix-7 FPGA but needs work to reach a reasonable frequency.
</p>

<div class="pet-project-title">
<a href="https://github.com/ben-marshall/microcoder" target="_blank">
microcoder
</a></div>
<p class="pet-project-description">
A tool which allows one to define a set of assembly-like "instructions", which
can then be used to write short programs. These programs are then transpiled
into a synthesisable verilog state-machine. The tool was born out of a need
to write lots of small sequential processes in verilog and getting fustrated
at the amount of boiler plate code needed. There are some examples of DMA
engines, simple counters and AXI bus interfaces.
