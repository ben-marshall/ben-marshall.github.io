<h1>To the IET, Engineering & Ethics</h1>

<p id="abstract"><i>
This is a copy of a letter I wrote to the IET magazine "Engineering and
Technology (E&T) in response to one of their articles. It was published in
their August 2016 Edition.
</i></p>

<p>
To the Editor
</p>
<p>
I read with delight your recent issue of E&T which discusses the various
modern parallels with Shelly's work which abound in modern Science and
Engineering.  This is undoubtedly something not discussed enough in our
profession. I was sad however to notice the omission of how we prepare new
engineers to face the various ethical conundrums their work throws up. Having
been through four years of University, I am leaving it worried about our
ability as engineers and individuals to face up to the kinds of issues that
the story of Victor Frankenstein forces us to consider.
</p>
<p>
We do not teach engineers to consider the societal & moral implications of
their work and design choices. I believe that if engineers are going to
meaningfully contribute to the public discourse on the development of new
technologies, we need better education on the applied ethical aspects of
engineering. Many of your examples were technologies which are still years
and decades from coming into existence, but in many cases we are already
building tools and systems which have effects we do not understand or
appreciate. Big data, the Internet of Things, Social Media and various other
trends in consumer electronics, where engineers can have an impact, are all
having huge effects on our society right now.
</p>
<p>
It is our duty as the facilitators of these changes to discuss the societal
and ethical implications publicly and from an informed perspective, and this
is something we are largely failing to do at the moment.
</p>
<p>
Yours Faithfully, Ben Marshall, MEng, MIET
