<h1>"It's All Just Academic"</h1>

<p id="abstract"><i>
In which I learn, shortly after starting a research job in academia, the
origin of the phrase "It's all just academic".
</i></p>

<p>
I started a new job recently, moving from engineering in industry to research
in academia. There are some contrasts in environment and attitude which have
struck me so far.
</p>

<p>
When designing a system / component / product in industry, there are often
numerous legacy constraints on how that system must function. In my case I
was helping to build a new CPU. This meant that we had to consider how
previous CPUs from the company behaved, so that our new one would also do the
same.  Interestingly, many behaviours which depend on how a piece of
functionality is implemented were often not documented in the Architecture
Reference Manual (the specification which all CPUs of a certain family adhere
to). Rather, they lived in the collective memory of the organisation. Either
in wiki pages, email chains, or between the ears of senior engineers. The
idiosyncracies arising from this are many and to be detailed elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
In academia, my impression so far is that legacy constraints are not given
nearly as much consideration. This is possibly because research papers or
projects seem to exist in silos with fewer interdependencies between
themselves and other implementations of <i>things</i>, whatever they may be.
It is sometimes assumed that because the object of research is the new, it
need not be constrained by legacy considerations. My impression is that this
lengthens lead times between new things appearing in academic literature, and
subsequently appearing in a product one can buy.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, academia seems to be more focused on concepts rather
than concrete implementations. This makes sense, since before something can
be researched (or much later, implemented) it must have a strong conceptual
grounding. It is sensible for a research environment, which focuses on
the new, to have its main output be conceptual, rather than concrete. A paper
might introduce a new idea giving the impression that it is fully formed
(especially if they have a reference implementation) but which in reality has
many real-world short comings. These might be assumptions which do not hold,
or simply conditions which occur in a real-world system that the authors do
not consider in their paper. This is not a bad thing. It means we have a
distinction between scientists (who further the concepts, with varying
degrees of implementation) and engineers (who must take the end result of
the research and cover the <i>last mile</i> to make it a concrete product).
</p>
<p>
I think that without a concerted effort to bridge the organisational (i.e.
university v.s. commercial entities) gaps between industry and research, there
is considerable room for each to misunderstand the other. My limited
experience has been that engineers in industry can be dismissive of academics
because of the shortcomings their output has when immediately applied
to the real world. They do not always appreciate the conceptual work that
the academics have put in to explain and experiment with their idea. Likewise,
if academics are not up to date with the kinds of constraints engineers in
industry face, then any work they produce will have a larger effort gap
between concept and implementation. In other words, it would all be just
academic.
